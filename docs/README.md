## Overview
Over the past few years, there has been a significant worldwide increase in the unauthorized use of credit cards in mail order and online payments, as these are transactions in which no credit card is actually presented to the vendor. Unless some sort of countermeasures are taken, this will cause enormous damage to credit card users and credit card companies.

## Business Challenge
In order to prevent unauthorized use, it is crucial to be able to infer the possibility of unauthorized transactions and to detect fraud from transaction details. We also recognize that the prompt identification of unauthorized transactions is an urgent issue for credit card companies and financial institutions.

They need to be able to quickly understand and analyze the trends of unauthorized spending for each time period and the geographical characteristics of unauthorized use and to learn how to take concrete preventive measures.

## Objectives and Goals
- **Objective**: Develop a solution using Azure Synapse Analytics, Power BI, and ONNX to detect and analyze credit card fraud.
- **Goals**:
    - Convert credit card fraud detection data into usable insights using Azure Synapse Analytics.
    - Implement PCA for dimensionality reduction.
    - Train a machine learning model using T-SQL in Azure Synapse Analytics.
    - Deploy the model using ONNX for interoperability.
    - Visualize the findings using Power BI.

## Tools and Technologies Used

### Azure Synapse Analytics
**Synopsis**  
Azure Synapse Analytics is an integrated analytics service that accelerates the time to insight across data warehouses and big data systems. It gives you the freedom to query data on your terms, using either serverless or dedicated resources—at scale.

**How It’s Used in the Project**:
- **Data Storage**: Azure Synapse is used to store and manage the credit card transaction data.
- **Data Processing**: T-SQL queries in Azure Synapse SQL are used to process and analyze the data.
- **Machine Learning**: Azure Synapse enables us to train machine learning models using T-SQL.
- **ONNX Integration**: Once the model is trained, it is converted into the ONNX format for deployment.

### Power BI
**Synopsis**  
Power BI is a business analytics solution that lets you visualize your data and share insights across your organization, or embed them in your app or website.

**How It’s Used in the Project**:
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI is used to create interactive reports and dashboards based on the insights generated from the Azure Synapse Analytics data.
- **Real-Time Reporting**: Power BI integrates with Azure Synapse to provide real-time data visualization.

### ONNX
**Synopsis**  
ONNX is an open-source ecosystem that enables AI developers to interchange models between different AI frameworks.

**How It’s Used in the Project**:
- **Model Exporting**: The trained machine learning models in Azure Synapse are exported in the ONNX format.
- **Interoperability**: ONNX allows us to deploy these models across various platforms, ensuring that the models are not locked into any specific framework.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
**What is PCA?**  
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is by far the most commonly used dimension reduction algorithm in machine learning.

**How PCA is Used in This Project**:
- PCA is applied to the credit card fraud detection dataset to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving as much variability as possible.
- This allows us to focus on the most important features and reduces the computational cost of the analysis.

## Machine Learning Algorithm Used
**Algorithm**: Linear Regression from Python's `scikit-learn` machine learning library.

**Explanation**:
- **Linear Regression**: It predicts response variables from the values of explanatory variables using a regression equation.
- **Why It’s Used**: Linear regression is used to make predictions about the probability of fraud in this scenario.

## Project Setup and Implementation

### Setting Up Azure Synapse Analytics
1. **Create Synapse Workspace**: Set up an Azure Synapse workspace to manage data and analytical workloads.
2. **Create SQL Pools**: Define serverless or dedicated SQL pools to query the data.

### Data Preparation and Transformation
1. **Data Upload**: Upload the credit card transaction dataset to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
2. **Data Processing**: Use T-SQL queries in Azure Synapse SQL to preprocess the data.
3. **PCA Transformation**: Apply PCA on the dataset to reduce the number of features.

### Training and Deploying the ML Model
1. **Model Training**: Train a linear regression model using T-SQL in Azure Synapse Analytics.
2. **Model Deployment**: Convert the trained model to the ONNX format for deployment.

### Integrating ONNX
1. **Model Export**: Export the trained model from Azure Synapse Analytics in ONNX format.
2. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the ONNX model in different environments as required.

### Creating Reports in Power BI
1. **Connect Power BI to Azure Synapse**: Link Power BI with Azure Synapse Analytics to retrieve processed data.
2. **Create Visualizations**: Develop interactive dashboards and reports that display the fraud detection insights.

## Results and Analysis
- **Model Performance**: Analyze the performance of the linear regression model and the effectiveness of PCA in reducing the dimensionality.
- **Business Insights**: Derive actionable insights from the visualizations in Power BI.

## Conclusion
- **Outcome**: Summarize the project outcome and the efficiency of using Azure Synapse Analytics, Power BI, and ONNX together.
- **Future Work**: Suggest possible future improvements and additional analysis that could be performed.
